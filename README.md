# css-battles-collection

Collection of my CSS Battles solutions.

## Why

All the solutions I found so far in the web focus on a 100% match regardless of what approach to use. I saw a lot of box-shadow tricks, pixel perfect margins and other stuff like that.
You know what? Those are gorgeous for the sake of the battle itself!
But.
The approach I use in my work life projects is totally different and I like to play the battles with this mindset.

Hope you can find those useful!

## My two cents

I had and am having fun with CSS battles. Just, I would like to challenge myself on some more real world battle, e.g. create some real world or fancy layout. That would be really instructive and something real to learn.
