# css-battles-collection
Collection of my CSS Battles solutions.

## Why
All the solutions I found so far in the web focus on a 100% match regardless of what approach to use. I saw a lot of box-shadow tricks, pixel perfect margins and other stuff like that.
You know what? Those are gorgeous for the sake of the battle itself!
But.
The approach I use in my work life projects is totally different and I like to play the battles with this mindset.

Hope you can find those useful!

PS: you can get in touch anytime to discuss solutions together!
