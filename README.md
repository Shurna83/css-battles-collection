## Why

I had and am having fun with CSS battles. Just, I would like to challenge myself on some more real world battle, e.g. create some real world or fancy layout. That would be really instructive and something real to learn.

All the solutions I found so far in the web focus on a 100% match or the highest score regardless of what approach to use. I saw a lot of box-shadow tricks, pixel perfect margins and other stuff like that.
You know what? Those are gorgeous for the sake of the battle itself!
But.
Such tricks are not actually maintainable in a real world life. The approach I use at work is totally different and I like to play the battles with another, more realistic, mindset.
Specifically, here are the conceptual steps I follow:

- body needs a reset

```css
body { margin: 0; height: 100%; }
```

- The vast majority of layouts are manageble with flex or grid layouts
- When it goes to guess pixel perfect margins, sizes with absolute positioning, it gets boring, unless the fun focuses on some other CSS aspect

Hope you can find those useful!
