[Here's the challenge](https://cssbattle.dev/play/L8aNhB0P9osr6O4TW7PQ)

## The solution

```html
<body bgcolor=#FEFAE0><div c><div b><div s></div><style>div[c]{position:fixed;left:120;top:70}div[b]{width:160;height:160;background:#9CCCDB;rotate:45deg}div[s]{width:80;height:80;background:#A461E8}
```

This is the first one, where I tried for fun to reach my highest score. Then decided for the next ones to use the same approach I would use at work.
